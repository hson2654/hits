Hey guys IT here don't forget to check your emails regarding the recent security breach. There is a web shell running on the server with no protection but it should be safe as I have ported over the filter from the old windows server to our new linux one. Your email will have the link to the shell.

Have you tried spawning a tty shell?
Also don't forget to check for hidden files ;)

The admin is dumb,
In fact everyone in the IT dept is pretty bad but I can’t blame all of them the newbies Sebastian and James are quite new to managing a server so I can forgive them for that password file they made on the server. But the admin now he’s quite something. Thinks he knows more than everyone else in the dept, he always yells at Sebastian and James now they do some dumb stuff but their new and this is just a high-school server who cares, the only people that would try and hack into this are script kiddies. His wallpaper policy also is redundant, why do we need custom wallpapers that doesn’t do anything. I have been suggesting time and time again to Bob ways we could improve the security since he “cares” about it so much but he just yells at me and says I don’t know what i’m doing. Sebastian has noticed and I gave him some tips on better securing his account, I can’t say the same for his friend James who doesn’t care and made his password: Qwerty. To be honest James isn’t the worst bob is his stupid web shell has issues and I keep telling him what he needs to patch but he doesn’t care about what I have to say. it’s only a matter of time before it’s broken into so because of this I have changed my password to

theadminisdumb

I hope bob is fired after the future second breach because of his incompetence. I almost want to fix it myself but at the same time it doesn’t affect me if they get breached, I get paid, he gets fired it’s a good time.
